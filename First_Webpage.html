	Hi, my name is Pablo as you can see from the title of this webpage. This is my first webpage and 
	plan on making many more.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Get To Know Me</h4>
	
	<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
	<p> 
	I First want to introduce myself to get others to know who I am and what I'm about. I am a CS Major 
	At the University of Utah and plan to Graduate on May 2025. Some of my favorite hobbies include
	playing sports such as basketball, soccer, and also enjoy skiiing, bicycling, long boarding, and skateboarding.
	I really love music and have always loved music my entire life. The instruments that I am most proficient include
	the Drums and the Viola, though I played Viola mostly in highschool, I plan on buying a 5 string violin so that.
	I can continue my practice in that area of music. I love to play the drums and it's my main instrument right
	now as I play in a band where we play latin rock music and also have some original Songs. 
	</p>
	
	<!-- List of goals -->
<p>
	In this Web Page I plan on completing these three goals
	<ul>
		<li>Link to Projects I've done in school</li>
		<li>Link to Favorite Websites</li>
		<li>Apply CSS to this Page</li>
		<li>Make a simple Investment Caculator that is functional within this website</li>
		<li>Add More if Needed</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
